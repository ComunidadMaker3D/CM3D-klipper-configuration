# Hotend fan.
# The stock firmware uses control ranges of PWM 0-50%, RPM 1000-8000.
# Change fan_speed below to match your preference. Measured speeds:
#   fan_speed 0.5:  50% PWM = 4000RPM (Prusa stock default speed)
#   fan_speed 1.0: 100% PWM = 8000RPM (safe but loud)

# Part cooling fan.
# The stock firmware uses control ranges of PWM 10-50%, RPM 500-5000.
# To match stock firmware, set the Klipper fan speed to 50%. This speed
# can be safely increased to 100% for better part cooling. Measured speeds:
#    50% PWM = 2500RPM (Prusa stock default speed)
#   100% PWM = 5000RPM (better cooling, still quiet)
